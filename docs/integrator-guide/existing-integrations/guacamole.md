# Cloudrock Guacamole integration

Guacamole is a browser based remote desktop gateway. It supports standard protocols like VNC, RDP, and SSH.
Cloudrock â€” Guacamole integration is based on Cloudrock's custom scripts functionality.

This integration provides full virtual desktop lifecycle, including:

- Creation of a virtual desktop in remote Cloudrock (i.e. OpenStack KVM machine)

```sql
ALTER TABLE guacamole_connection ADD backend_id VARCHAR(50);

```bash
# Guacamole MySQL connection settings
MYSQL_USER=guacamole
MYSQL_DATABASE=guacamole
MYSQL_PASSWORD=password
MYSQL_HOSTNAME=guacamole.example.com
# RDP Password for the desktop user
DESKTOP_PASSWORD=password
# Backend Cloudrock connection settings
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_URL=https://cloudrock.example.com/api/
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_TOKEN=api_token
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_OFFERING=offerring_uuid
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_PROJECT=project_uuid
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_IMAGE=image_name
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_FLAVOR=flavor_name
BACKEND_CLOUDROCK_SUBNET=subnet_uuid
